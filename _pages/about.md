Welcome to my site. 

I’m a first-year PhD student in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. 

I graduated from the University of California, Davis with a B.S. in Genetics and Genomics with minors in Statistics and Professional Writing in 2020. I was an active undergraduate researcher and worked on multiple research projects at UC Davis, Stanford University, and Genentech. My senior thesis centered on the topology of the Rabl configuration in _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_. To learn more about my research interests please see my CV. 

My love for scientific research is only rivalled by my passion for writing and scientific communication. I aspire to a career in research and science journalism, hoping to write nonfiction literature for young adults. In 2019, I was awarded the Norma J. Lang Prize for my review paper on radiomics techniques in ultrasonography. That same year I worked with UC Davis History Professor Ellen Hartigan-O’Connor in 2019 year on an independent research project _Women in Science in America: A Wikipedia Project_, in which I wrote peer-reviewed Wikipedia articles about female scientists lost to history. I am currently interning with the Siegel Lab to copyedit their open-source lab manual for educators.
