I’m a 4th year undergraduate student at University of California, Davis pursuing a B.S. in Genetics and Genomics with minors in Statistics and Professional Writing. Currently, I am an intern at Genentech working with Pharma Technical Operations – Biological Technologies.
At UC Davis, I am part of the Arsuaga-Vazquez lab in the Department of Mathematics, studying topological statistics in genome analysis. My funding comes from the NSF’s Research Training Group (RTG). In addition, I am working on projects in machine learning as an undergraduate research assistant in the Crofoot Lab. My work was most recently accepted to the Women in Machine Learning Workshop, and the UC Davis Undergraduate Research Conference. Aside from my computational background, I have researched bacterial evolution as part of the Foley Lab at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.
