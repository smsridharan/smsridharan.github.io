A ground-breaking 2019 study led by UC Berkeley’s Noah Whiteman elucidated how the monarch butterfly has conferred its ability to feed off of milkweed, a poisonous plant that is harmful to nearly all other species. Researchers have been able to deduce how the monarch found its ecological niche by identifying three key amino acids substitutions in CRISPR-based “monarch flies.” The novel marriage between the purviews of molecular biology and fruit fly genetics in this study not only helps us better understand America’s national insect but also shows incredible promise for future research at the interface of evolutionary biology and CRISPR technology. 
The monarch's quintessential image and capabilities in entomology lies in a story that is shaped by both evolutionary biology and philosophy. Stephen Jay Gould remarked in his magnum opus Wonderful Life - The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History,  that “any replay of the tape of life would lead evolution down a pathway radically different from the road actually taken.” Whiteman’s group took this idea into consideration and questioned the road taken by the monarchs to toxin resistance. They had two guiding questions: how did the monarch evolve toxin resistance, and was that genetic path predictable?

 Milkweed is the monarch butterfly’s only source of nourishment. The plant’s main toxin is ouabain, which interferes with the sodium-potassium pump that allows cells to properly function. Most species die when they eat milkweed: without the sodium-potassium ions in the proper gradient, cells lose control of their processes. The heart begins to beat so fervently that cardiac arrest is imminent. Few species can do what the monarch can do – making the milkweed plants prime real estate that few other organisms want to bid on. 
The group began by looking at the handful of species, such as aphids, certain beetles, and milkweed bugs, who were also capable of sequestering milkweed toxins. By comparing the genetic landscapes of their sodium pumps, it was evidenced that insects contained similar amino acid substitutions in positions 111, 119, and 122. But this was still a hypothesis with evidence in its infancy. “Until CRISPR,” explains Dr. Marianthi Karageorgi, postdoctoral researcher and co-first author of the study, “establishing causation would have been very difficult to do.”

Despite molecular biology advances, manipulating the sodium pump remains a challenging process. For nearly seven years the group worked on harnessing CRISPR technology to the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing was employed to manipulate the three specific sites of interest, ultimately generating viable lines of fruit flies with these mutations. These substitutions successively increased the toxin resistance in the “monarch flies.” 
But like all good things, toxin resistance did not come without a price. Female flies were subjected to a “bang sensitivity assay,” in which a vial with a single female fly was vortexed at 3000 rpm for ten seconds. Wild-type flies (those that were not modified) were not paralyzed like their CRISPR modified counterparts. “On one hand these mutations confer resistance,” Karagerorgi explained, “but on the other hand, they have a fitness cost.” 

This cost of paralysis motivated the order in which the amino acid substitutions appeared in the monarch. Understanding the adaptive landscape of the mutations became critical to understanding the order in which they appeared. Mutations that allowed for high bang sensitivity, but low toxin-resistance were unfavorable. Similarly, mutations that allowed for high toxin-resistance, but low bang-sensitivity were also deleterious. The study proved that the evolutionary order of these mutations ultimately accounted for both these factors – maximizing toxin resistance and minimizing bang sensitivity.

The use of CRISPR-Cas9 in this study establishes that precision genome editing can be employed to test the adaptive evolution hypothesis in vivo. “The future direction of this research can go in many ways,” said Karageorgi. “I’m extremely interested in the regulator of the sodium pump – and we have good systems to study this in.”

In recent years, the monarch butterfly has been in the news as scientists and conservationists alike try to petition its place on the endangered species list. But interest in the monarch isn’t a new one. “In Europe we don’t have monarch butterflies,” Karageorgi concluded. “Before coming to the United States, I had no idea that when I would do this study people would be so crazy about them.”
