The Batrachomyomachia or “The Battle of Frogs and Mice” is a famous story from antiquity. Psycharpax, the Mouse Prince, escapes a cat’s clutches and seeks aid from Physignathus, the Frog King. Physignathus offers Psycharpax passage across the lake on his back, but suddenly, a water snake appears. In the tussle, Physignathus forgets about Psycharpax, leading to the latter’s death. One of Psycharpax’s subjects witnesses the prince’s death, assumes it was premeditated murder, and a one-day war ensues between the mice and frogs; even the Greek Gods are involved. Although the mice initially prevail, the frogs come out victorious in the end — at a cost. 

The frog denouncing ere he breathed his last;
"You shall not 'scape Heaven's vengeance; soon or late
This deed perfidious towards your friend will blast,
Whom shipwreck'd from your back, as from a rock, you cast.

Stories like The Batrachomyomachia are not isolated. Cultures around the world revere amphibians, a word meaning “double life.” In ancient Egypt, the goddess of fertility, Hequet, was represented in the form of a frog. Native Americans have looked to salamanders and toads as pillars of strength in many of their customs. In India, the “marriage” of two frogs is cited to bring rain in times of drought. Apart from their religious and spiritual significance, amphibian biodiversity has been a cornerstone of science education for centuries — from frog dissections, to ecological field work training. 

The amphibian’s contributions to science and medicine are self-evident, but in recent years these species have been declining at an alarming rate, with many even going extinct. Mesoamerica and Brazil remain some of the hardest hit regions with studies pointing to nearly 300 species with significant declines between them. No amphibian was spared. Population downturns were proportionate to taxonomic abundance, with anurans (frogs and toads) the most severely affected. This mass mortality is one that is sudden, and one that certain scientists attribute to the sixth extinction. 

What could possibly devastate biodiversity at such a scale? The answer lies at the intersection of ecology, genetics, epidemiology, and a great deal of bad luck. 

**The Chytrid Fungus** 

The story starts more than 150 years ago. The first documented case of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatids (Bd) was recorded in 1863 in the Titicaca water frog. Described as having fungal spots, scientists remained puzzled but unconcerned about its bizarre appearance. Then, in 1993, scientists in Western Australia began to survey dead and dying frogs formally classifying the chytrid fungus. 

Bd is transmitted through water borne zoospores. Once they land on a host they multiply. Amphibians slowly become more lethargic and their skin peels off. It is a slow and painful death. For creatures that rely so heavily on their skin for evapotranspiration — “sweat for frogs” — one that is particularly devastating. 

At UC Berkeley, scientists in the Rosenblum Lab have been researching Bd and its diversity. The virus does not present in all amphibians the same, so they became curious about the fungal, environmental, and molecular mechanisms for these differences. It was clear that the scientific understanding of the fungus’ genetic diversity was incomplete, so an international effort was made to better characterize the mysterious differences. The Rosenblum lab coordinated a research effort that spanned the continents to better understand what made Bd tick.  

Graduate student and conservation geneticist Allison Byrne led the five-year study on the virus’ cryptic diversity. “Biodiversity is declining at such an alarming rate. Even if we were able to breed species in captivity or protect some areas, when we get down to a small population size there’s just a high probability of extinction. I am motivated by the conservation crisis that we are in.” And she’s right — extinction is such an imminent and verifiable threat to many amphibian species, who are being attacked on all sides by climate change, environmental destruction, and the chytrid fungus, just to name a few. 

Scientists initially believed that the chytrid fungus was attributed to a single Bd lineage known as BdGPL. But as the virus began to trapeze the globe, interest in how one disease could affect so many amphibian species reached a fever pitch. “It was a very interesting puzzle,” Rosenblum notes. “There are still a lot of mysteries — but it was this very mysterious thing that was happening — amphibians around the world were disappearing at the same time. And while a pathogen was described as responsible for that, we knew very little about whether or why some species would be susceptible while others would be resistant.”

Much of what scientists are able to learn because of the chytrid fungus lies in the advent of new technological perspectives to study it. Researchers began to focus on three main questions: how do we characterize the diversity of the chytrid fungus, when did this panzootic emerge, and what causes are expediting its diversity and virulence?

**Fungal Origins** 

The expansion of BdGPL in the 20th century coincides with historical evidence showing the rise of amphibian transport for exotic pet, medical, and food purposes. Findings point to East Asia, mainly the Korean Peninsula, as the geographic hot spot for the disease’s emergence. BdASIA-1 exhibits the hallmarks of an ancestral population that seeded the pandemic. Pairwise comparisons among Bd samples show that the average number of segregating sites among BdASIA samples is higher than any other lineage. In other words, BdASIA samples branch off into their own strains higher than any other geographic family of the chytrid fungus. 

But simply knowing where the fungus originated was not enough. Researchers at the Rosenblum lab were keen to separate the broad geographic lineages into something finer in scale. While BdGPL is globally distributed, and accounts for most of the cases, specific strains within geographic isolates provide more clarity into fungal similarities and differences. For example, BdCAPE is not only widely found in the African continent, but also found in samples collected in the United Kingdom. Similarly, there are grave similarities between samples collected in Asia and those in Brazil. These classifications do more than tell us about where these samples came from — they also tell us where they are going.

**An Ongoing Attack: Hybridization and Virulence**

Hybridization between Bd samples isn’t something to be taken lightly. For decades, the scientific community believed that Bd was reproducing clonally — dividing without sexual recombination. When a fungus clonally divides it makes a copy of itself. Mutations, or errors, within the DNA sequence sometimes cause it to acquire new properties. However, researchers were alarmed when they found hybrid lineages. These lineages are caused by mating, and oftentimes, the worst of both are passed down to the “next generation” of fungus. That’s a big problem and causes Bd to become more deadly as the years go by. 

The molecular mechanisms for this recombination have not yet been elucidated, but the devastating environmental effects have. When closely related chytrid species combine sexually, a resistant long-lasting spore stage is formed, coming back to life when it finds a suitable host. And when distantly related chytrid species combine, the phenotypic effects they have on amphibians are more deadly than ever observed before. This poses a significant risk to amphibians in places like South America, where many strains of Bd have been found. In the past, researchers noticed that amphibians are more susceptible to different strains of Bd depending on where they are in their life cycle. Tadpoles were more susceptible to BdGPL and BdASIA-1 than their BdCAPE and European BdCH counterparts. But as they grew into post metamorphic adults, BdGPL was more deadly. 

Bd strains combining could challenge what researchers know about virulence. It could be possible that tadpoles and larvae, who generally remained unaffected by the fungus would die before metamorphosis, eradicating populations. It could also cause mature amphibians, who so far have been able to withstand the fungus with some difficulty, unable to cope. 

**On Trade, Climate Change, and Mitigation** 

A leading hypothesis in how Bd continues to spread lies in the amphibian trade. “Research has mostly been focused on bullfrogs which are widely traded for food,” explains Byrne. “We found that bullfrogs are tolerant carriers of the chytrid fungus and contain heavy fungal loads without presenting symptoms.” Evidence shows that there are different Bd lineages on bullfrogs, and in general most specimens are highly infected in both commercial farms and in the wild. 

“With globalization a lot of very poor South American host huge farms to raise and export these frogs to Asia where they are eaten,” says herpetologist and disease ecologist Dr. Patricia Burrowes, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico. “Frogs are coming in from all over the world, being farmed in South America and are moving back to Asia. As you can imagine, this is a lot of back and forth.” A jailbreak from a commercial facility wreaks havoc on local amphibian populations. And because bullfrogs are invasive species, they take to new ecological communities and do more than just spreading the panzootic.

The solutions to eradicating Bd aren’t as simple as trade embargoes and travel bans. The adverse effects of climate change disproportionately affect amphibians. “When ponds are desiccated and the phenology changes, that affects amphibians in all over the world,” emphasizes Burrowes. Changes in the rains, in some places coming earlier and others later, makes it difficult for many amphibians to breed, especially those that have an aquatic larval stage. Even without Bd amphibians would struggle to survive.

But decimating amphibian breeding grounds is only one flank of the Bd-climate change attack. As ectotherms, amphibians require external sources to regulate their body temperature making them highly vulnerable to global warming. To make matters worse, the chytrid fungus grows much faster in the temperature range of 17-23℃, frequently more common globally. “In the tropics, the amphibians that live in the mountains have been the most affected by the chytrid fungus.” Burrowes explains. “Amphibians are stressed by the new pathogen affecting them, but the climate also starts playing tricks on them. In places it gets warmer. In places it gets drier. Stress increases — and when an animal gets stressed, it becomes immunologically depressed. That gives an advantage to the pathogen.”

However, unlike many fungi which die upon desiccation, Bd does not. Zoospores remain dormant until the rains, suddenly affecting entire populations almost instantly. In fact, the period of dormancy appears to increase in hybridized strains — making it increasingly more potent as the genetic diversity of the chytrid fungus explodes. 

To make matters worse, there doesn’t appear to be a cure. “There are treatments you can do in the lab on individual frogs. You can treat them with an antifungal, and even heat the frog up to clear their infection if the organism’s biology is suited for it,” But with a pause, Byrne continues, “As far as in nature, however, we have not found an effective means of mitigating it. Especially in diverse amphibian communities, and with Bd being such a generalist, you have animals that are tolerant even with high fungal loads — reservoirs for spreading chytrid back into the environment.”

For this reason, Rosenblum’s lab has stopped doing live-animal lab work. “I can’t justify infecting healthy animals with a deadly virus if I don’t even believe that the results I get in the lab are comparable to what they are experiencing in the field.” While not against other scientists doing experimental work, like many conservationists, Rosenblum believes that the environmental dynamics in the “real world” are the only ones that matter. 

**Bd in the United States** 

When we see global declines in amphibians, researchers naturally turn to their own backyards to learn more about what affects their local biodiversity. “Bd has probably been in the United States for a very long time,” explains Byrne. “Most of the frogs in the eastern United States have it.” Because of the length of time these animals have spent with the fungus, it is possible they have evolved biological mechanisms to tolerate its attack. 

But these observations do not hold true for the entire country.  A few species, including the California Mountain Yellow-legged frog, studied in the Rosenblum lab, have seen sharp declines. Byrne’s new focus is learning more about Bd within the United States.  “It’s actually really surprising how relatively little we know about Bd genotypes across the country,” Byrne commented. “We’re finding a startling amount of diversity on the regional scale.” 

**A Marriage of Fieldwork and Molecular Biology**

For scientists like Burrowes, the charge against the chytrid fungus is a personal one. “I have described new species to science that no longer exist because of Bd. When you see that — when you discover and describe this new frog to science — it’s beautiful. And then, this frog is no longer there — you go to this place again, and you don’t find it. I cannot describe that feeling. It’s really devastating.” 

These field work experiences of working intimately with the amphibians they study is what appears to motivate many of the scientists determined to protect amphibian biodiversity. “I studied abroad at Bioko Island, part of Equatorial Guinea, where I had an experience with tropical fieldwork and amphibian surveys,” Byrne recalls, “It was really that first field experience that set things in motion for me. I fell in love with amphibians — the actual field work of looking for them, catching them, studying them. It was with that I found that innate conservation ethic that pushed me into what I study now.” 

With better technology employable to study the chytrid fungus, scientists like Byrne and Burrowes enjoy wearing new hats. “I was always fascinated by what we can learn using DNA sequences,” says Byrne, “It was really rewarding — albeit time-consuming — to get these back and find another lineage of Bd. It’s really exciting to see what’s under the hood in that way.” 

Dr. Rosenblum’s lab relies heavily on the new molecular biology technologies that make understanding more about Bd possible. “In the early 2000s when I was a graduate student, advanced genetic and genomic tools were only being used in model species — a lot of my colleagues were working on amphibian declines from the ecology side. So, when it came time to find a postdoc project, I decided to build genomic resources to study non-model organisms.” 

Rosenblum’s project had ecological and conservation relevance. Her efforts allowed researchers to study Bd from both the host side and pathogen side, a perspective unavailable before. “Nowadays, there are all these tools that can be used to help address this pressing conservation question, but at that time, that link was not easy to make.”

“We were able to sequence some of the first Bd genomes using genome sequencing, and then it was clear we needed a lot more samples to get more information from around the world to better understand what was going on,” explained Rosenblum. Whole-genome sequencing, however, is known to be finicky. With endangered species as the heart of this project, it would be difficult to source and sequence samples. Byrne and Rosenblum developed a cheap and easy assay that would work on even degraded DNA to accommodate for these constraints. Now, a simple cotton swab on the amphibian’s skin is enough to analyze Bd in the lab — minimizing both the economic and technical efforts that came with more traditional and expensive techniques. 

By leveraging this new assay, Rosenblum was able to reach out to collaborators around the world to characterize the chytrid fungus. “Even if collaborators didn’t have tens of thousands of pure Bd cultures in their fridges, they could have tens of thousands of swabs.” And since then, there has been overwhelming support from the research community in light of the lab’s discovery. “With amphibian decline as such a global issue,” Rosenblum continues, “there’s a lot of camaraderie and collegiality among the research community.” 

The interaction between pathogen processes, host processes, and the environment will require the use of advanced technology in the future, especially as amphibian species become rarer and technology less expensive. “New technology allows us to ask questions that we wouldn’t even be able to ask before,” Rosenblum insists. “But in a lot of ways, I’m not tired of the methods we have already. From a molecular standpoint, the leading edge in this field is more on the analytical side, because we can get a ton of data without needing sophisticated ways to analyze it.” 

**The Big Picture**

It is likely that we are still seeing only a small part of the story. The work of characterizing where Bd is, how it’s spread so explosively, what the characteristics of the different lineages are has made huge strides toward understanding this panzootic. But with hundreds of untapped samples in museums, there is still the opportunity to go back in time and reconstruct the history of Bd’s arrival to different corners of the world. Observing ancient disease dynamics provides a unique lens to how the chytrid fungus has gone as unchecked as it did. Temporal and spatial resolution would allow scientists to better understand what can be done for the next inevitable panzootic. 

After all, emerging infectious diseases continue to be major threats to not just wildlife but human populations as well. Bd is symptomatic of a huge issue that has arisen due to globalization. As we move around, diseases and pathogens do too. Interest in pandemics and panzootics cannot be selfish — the approach must be holistic. Regulation and concern about human pathogens alone will leave a vacuum in which biodiversity is lost. “We need to be concerned about pathogens of wildlife, the pathogens of agriculture too,” says Rosenblum. “It’s all the same process. The globalized transport of all sorts of critters around the planet has economic, public health, and ecological effects.”  

As a society, it is critical we understand what we are doing as human beings that accelerate the evolution and spread of deadly pathogens like Bd. It is a universal issue, and one that should not center simply in human health, but in a global “one health” perspective. Everything on the planet is interconnected — at the rate we are going, it is very likely that we could lose an entire layer of the food web and ecosystem. Losing a branch to the tree of life should not be accepted quietly. “Humans cannot ‘technology’ their way out of the aftermath of environmental degradation,” emphasizes Rosenblum. “This is increasingly becoming obvious.”
