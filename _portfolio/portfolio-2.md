The Batrachomyomachia or “The Battle of Frogs and Mice” is a famous story from antiquity. Psycharpax, the Mouse Prince, escapes a cat’s clutches and seeks aid from Physignathus, the Frog King. Physignathus offers Psycharpax passage across the lake on his back, but suddenly, a water snake appears. In the tussle, Physignathus forgets about Psycharpax, leading to the latter’s death. One of Psycharpax’s subjects witnesses the prince’s death, assumes it was premeditated murder, and a one-day war ensues between the mice and frogs; even the Greek Gods are involved. Although the mice initially prevail, the frogs come out victorious in the end — at a cost. 

The frog denouncing ere he breathed his last;
"You shall not 'scape Heaven's vengeance; soon or late
This deed perfidious towards your friend will blast,
Whom shipwreck'd from your back, as from a rock, you cast.

Stories like The Batrachomyomachia are not isolated. Cultures around the world revere amphibians, a word meaning “double life.” In ancient Egypt, the goddess of fertility, Hequet, was represented in the form of a frog. Native Americans have looked to salamanders and toads as pillars of strength in many of their customs. In India, the “marriage” of two frogs is cited to bring rain in times of drought. Apart from their religious and spiritual significance, amphibian biodiversity has been a cornerstone of science education for centuries — from frog dissections, to ecological field work training. 

The amphibian’s contributions to science and medicine are self-evident, but in recent years these species have been declining at an alarming rate, with many even going extinct. Mesoamerica and Brazil remain some of the hardest hit regions with studies pointing to nearly 300 species with significant declines between them. No amphibian was spared. Population downturns were proportionate to taxonomic abundance, with anurans (frogs and toads) the most severely affected. This mass mortality is one that is sudden, and one that certain scientists attribute to the sixth extinction. 

What could possibly devastate biodiversity at such a scale? The answer lies at the intersection of ecology, genetics, epidemiology, and a great deal of bad luck. 

**The Chytrid Fungus** 

The story starts more than 150 years ago. The first documented case of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatids (Bd) was recorded in 1863 in the Titicaca water frog. Described as having fungal spots, scientists remained puzzled but unconcerned about its bizarre appearance. Then, in 1993, scientists in Western Australia began to survey dead and dying frogs formally classifying the chytrid fungus. 

Bd is transmitted through water borne zoospores. Once they land on a host they multiply. Amphibians slowly become more lethargic and their skin peels off. It is a slow and painful death. For creatures that rely so heavily on their skin for evapotranspiration — “sweat for frogs” — one that is particularly devastating. 

At UC Berkeley, scientists in the Rosenblum Lab have been researching Bd and its diversity. The virus does not present in all amphibians the same, so they became curious about the fungal, environmental, and molecular mechanisms for these differences. It was clear that the scientific understanding of the fungus’ genetic diversity was incomplete, so an international effort was made to better characterize the mysterious differences. The Rosenblum lab coordinated a research effort that spanned the continents to better understand what made Bd tick.  

Graduate student and conservation geneticist Allison Byrne led the five-year study on the virus’ cryptic diversity. “Biodiversity is declining at such an alarming rate. Even if we were able to breed species in captivity or protect some areas, when we get down to a small population size there’s just a high probability of extinction. I am motivated by the conservation crisis that we are in.” And she’s right — extinction is such an imminent and verifiable threat to many amphibian species, who are being attacked on all sides by climate change, environmental destruction, and the chytrid fungus, just to name a few. 

Scientists initially believed that the chytrid fungus was attributed to a single Bd lineage known as BdGPL. But as the virus began to trapeze the globe, interest in how one disease could affect so many amphibian species reached a fever pitch. “It was a very interesting puzzle,” Rosenblum notes. “There are still a lot of mysteries — but it was this very mysterious thing that was happening — amphibians around the world were disappearing at the same time. And while a pathogen was described as responsible for that, we knew very little about whether or why some species would be susceptible while others would be resistant.”

Much of what scientists are able to learn because of the chytrid fungus lies in the advent of new technological perspectives to study it. Researchers began to focus on three main questions: how do we characterize the diversity of the chytrid fungus, when did this panzootic emerge, and what causes are expediting its diversity and virulence?

**Fungal Origins** 

The expansion of BdGPL in the 20th century coincides with historical evidence showing the rise of amphibian transport for exotic pet, medical, and food purposes. Findings point to East Asia, mainly the Korean Peninsula, as the geographic hot spot for the disease’s emergence. BdASIA-1 exhibits the hallmarks of an ancestral population that seeded the pandemic. Pairwise comparisons among Bd samples show that the average number of segregating sites among BdASIA samples is higher than any other lineage. In other words, BdASIA samples branch off into their own strains higher than any other geographic family of the chytrid fungus. 

But simply knowing where the fungus originated was not enough. Researchers at the Rosenblum lab were keen to separate the broad geographic lineages into something finer in scale. While BdGPL is globally distributed, and accounts for most of the cases, specific strains within geographic isolates provide more clarity into fungal similarities and differences. For example, BdCAPE is not only widely found in the African continent, but also found in samples collected in the United Kingdom. Similarly, there are grave similarities between samples collected in Asia and those in Brazil. These classifications do more than tell us about where these samples came from — they also tell us where they are going.
