A free and fair press comes with disadvantages. Nearly every avenue of free speech — from television news to social media — has dedicated time or provided a platform to discuss COVID-19. Even if we’ve managed to avoid contracting the virus, there is no way we have managed to avoid hearing about it. The fatigue that comes from listening to repeated stories about the pandemic comes with a [cost](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200505-coronavirus-how-much-news-is-too-much). At best, we know what the disease can do, how potent it is, and why we must follow guidelines by the CDC. At worst, we become desensitized and lose patience with the organizations and governmental institutions designed to keep us safe. 

In the years to come the American press must take its fair share of blame when a post-mortem of this pandemic is conducted. Between publishing premature articles about potential vaccines and covering sub-par research in academia, hysteria about COVID-19 has increased. The aftermath of these systemic failures will leave a profound impact on the American public, not only in terms of the trust, but also in the relationship the average citizen will share with the first amendment. 

COVID-19 has become a time for opportunists. Many [pharmaceutical companies](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GILD/) have dramatically surged in stock market value as whisperings of potential vaccines leaked into the public domain. On the whole, these stories have been premature. Drugs like hydroxychloroquine received an immense amount of coverage, only for information to be [retracted](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/health/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine.html) afterward. Others like Remdesvir have been [scrutinized](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-trial-shows-remdesivir-accelerates-recovery-advanced-covid-19) by the news and shown scientific promise — only to be overshadowed by more sensational stories of [injecting bleach](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52407177). It is a shame that American leadership has fallen apart at the seams, but the press is uniquely responsible for giving a platform to these stories in the first place; dozens of articles reiterating the dangerous and irresponsible statements of irreverent ideologues populate the news channels. 

Such sensationalism comes with a price. Misinterpreting the newest trials has led people into a frenzy. The idea that a solution to this pandemic is imminent provides an incredible amount of false hope. The scientific reality is markedly different from the one pushed by the press. Instead of focusing on the research and turning the platform to scientists actively engaged with the scientific method, a band-aid appears to be plastered on the problem. “No news is good news” is an axiom no longer. 

Meanwhile the academic press has seen a surge in articles. Nearly 15 thousand articles were published in [bioRxiv](https://connect.biorxiv.org/relate/content/181) over the last two months on papers surrounding COVID-19. Only a handful of these articles will be accepted by bona fide journals. Shoddy methods, improper sampling, hasty conclusions and writing filled with inaccuracies and typos clutter the preprint server. The local press, upon hearing word that groundbreaking COVID-19 research is being conducted in their own backyards, jump to the scene. Most conclusions remain unsettled (and thereby unexciting news), but others fall into the grey-area of dangerous science and conspiracy theory. The average reader is more compelled by the latter — leading to dangerous sentiments ranging from anxiety to xenophobia. 

Perhaps this is why science journalism matters now more than ever. Great science journalists work for years on their craft, learning how to communicate clearly with the general public — but the pandemic has birthed many charlatans. By simply echoing the stories of their peers the media distills what could be a powerful moment into something entirely derivative. And with a 24 hour news cycle, until the “next big thing” a story is covered repeatedly — sometimes to the point of boredom. To counter this phenomena, scientists must be leading the charge, controlling the coverage and guiding the conversation. Experts must rise to the challenge and learn how to communicate about their own work. Otherwise, the burden of communication transfers to the media, who have proven themselves willing prey to sensationalism. 

Reforming the American press is impossible —  and many believe it is entirely un-American to suggest that the coverage of COVID-19 has been inadequate. Only time can judge the way this pandemic was handled. As the years progress, we will realize how much clutter filled our 2020 newsfeeds. Not only were people overwhelmed with information, they were also told what to feel about it. Science is not unfeeling — but it certainly does not rely on the human psyche to stay relevant. As we move into the next phase of the virus, we must recognize the role that science journalism must play. The last thing we need is a word plague.
